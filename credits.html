<h1>Credits</h1>
Concept and implemetation by Paul-Gabriel Müller. The purpose was to have an app for myself to learn some malagasy words, and to share it in case someone else finds it useful as well. 
I am aware that the app is far from polished and perfect, but I can still find it useful with it's flaws. By the way, implementation was done in Javascript with Angular and ported to App Store with Apache Cordova. 
Most words were taken from the book "Lehrbuch der madagassischen Sprache" by Janie Noëlle Rasoloson.
